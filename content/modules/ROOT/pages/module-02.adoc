_A guide to using the Ansible extension for Visual Studio Code to scaffold a new Ansible collection and playbook project._

---

== Lab Briefing

In this exercise, you will create an Ansible collection and a playbook using the Ansible extension's wizard in Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

When the laboratory environment is ready, you will be able to click the green **Start** button in the bottom right corner.

== Lab Guide: Hands-On Tasks

Welcome to this hands-on introduction to Ansible Development Tools (ADT). You will learn how to create, test, and deploy an Ansible collection using the `ansible-creator` tool through the Ansible extension for VS Code.

For this lab, all necessary tools and dependencies are pre-installed and configured for you.

=== Task 1: Explore the Ansible Extension

First, get started with the graphical interface for `ansible-creator`, which is a feature of the Ansible extension for VS Code.

.   **Locate and open the Ansible extension** by clicking the Ansible icon in the left sidebar of VS Code. You will see three sections: *Ansible Development Tools*, *Ansible Lightspeed*, and *Ansible Lightspeed Feedback*.

.   **Collapse the Lightspeed sections** to simplify the view, as you will be working with *Ansible Development Tools*.

=== Task 2: Create a Collection Project

Next, you will scaffold a new Ansible collection.

.   **Open the Collection project creator** by clicking the **Collection project** link in the *Ansible Development Tools* section.

.   **Fill out the collection details** in the new tab that opens. Use the following information:
* **Namespace:** `mynamespace`
* **Collection:** `mycollection`
* **Init path:**
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
/home/rhel/myansibleproject/collections/ansible_collections/mynamespace/mycollection
----
+
* **Check** the box for `Install collection from source code (editable mode)`.
+

.   **Create the collection** by clicking the blue **Create** button. After a few moments, you should see the creation details appear in the *Logs* box.

=== Task 3: Create a Playbook Project

Now, you will create a separate playbook project.

.   **Open the Playbook project creator** by clicking the **Playbook project** link in the Ansible extension sidebar.
+

.   **Fill out the playbook project details** in the new tab. Use the following information:
* **Destination directory:** `/home/rhel/myansibleproject`
* **Namespace:** `mynamespace`
* **Collection:** `mysecondcollection`

.   **Create the project** by clicking the **Create** button. After a couple of seconds, you should see a success message in the logs.

=== Task 4: Open the Collection Folder

Due to a lab infrastructure limitation, you will now manually open the folder where your new collection content was created.

.   **Open the file Explorer** by clicking the Explorer icon (the icon with two files) in the VS Code left sidebar.
+

.   **Open the collection folder** by clicking the **(1) Open Folder** button. In the path field, paste the following path **(2)** and click the blue **OK** button **(3)**.
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
/home/rhel/myansibleproject/collections/ansible_collections/mynamespace/mycollection/
----

.   **View the scaffolded files** once the VS Code screen reloads. You will see the complete directory structure and all the files created by the Ansible extension for your new collection in the left sidebar.
