_A guide to using the Ansible extension for Visual Studio Code to scaffold a new Ansible collection and playbook project._

---

== Lab Briefing

In this exercise, you will create an Ansible collection and a playbook using the Ansible extension's wizard in Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

When the laboratory environment is ready, you will be able to click the green **Start** button in the bottom right corner.

== Lab Guide: Hands-On Tasks

Welcome to this hands-on introduction to Ansible Development Tools (ADT). You will learn how to create, test, and deploy an Ansible collection using the `ansible-creator` tool through the Ansible extension for VS Code.

For this lab, all necessary tools and dependencies are pre-installed and configured for you.

=== Task 1: Explore the Ansible Extension

Let's get started with the graphical interface for `ansible-creator`, which is a feature of the Ansible extension for VS Code.

.   **Locate the Ansible extension.**
+
    In the left sidebar of VS Code, you will see an Ansible icon.
+

.   **Open the extension view.**
+
    **Click** on the Ansible icon to see the available options. You will see three sections:
+
    * Ansible Development Tools
    * Ansible Lightspeed
    * Ansible Lightspeed Feedback

.   **Collapse the Lightspeed sections.**
+
    You will be working with *Ansible Development Tools*. To simplify the view, **click** the arrows to collapse the two Lightspeed sections for now.

=== Task 2: Create a Collection Project

Next, you will scaffold a new Ansible collection.

.   **Open the Collection project creator.**
+
    In the *Ansible Development Tools* section, **click** on the **Collection project** link.
+

.   **Fill out the collection details.**
+
    A new tab will open with a form. **Fill** in the fields with the following information:
+
    * **Namespace:** `mynamespace`
    * **Collection:** `mycollection`
    * **Init path:**
+
[source,text]
----
/home/rhel/myansibleproject/collections/ansible_collections/mynamespace/mycollection
----
+
    * **Check** the box for `Install collection from source code (editable mode)`.
+

.   **Create the collection.**
+
    **Click** the blue **Create** button. After a few moments, you should see the creation details appear in the *Logs* box.

=== Task 3: Create a Playbook Project

Now, you will create a separate playbook project.

.   **Open the Playbook project creator.**
+
    In the Ansible extension sidebar, **click** on the **Playbook project** link.
+

.   **Fill out the playbook project details.**
+
    A new tab will open with a form. **Fill** in the fields with the following information:
+
    * **Destination directory:** `/home/rhel/myansibleproject`
    * **Namespace:** `mynamespace`
    * **Collection:** `mysecondcollection`

.   **Create the project.**
+
    **Click** the **Create** button. After a couple of seconds, you should see a success message in the logs.
+

Note: playbook project created at /home/rhel/myansibleproject
----

=== Task 4: Open the Collection Folder

Due to a lab infrastructure limitation, you will now manually open the folder where your new collection content was created.

.   **Open the file Explorer.**
+
    In the VS Code left sidebar, **click** the **Explorer** icon (the icon with two files).
+

.   **Open the collection folder.**
+
    **Click** the **(1) Open Folder** button. In the path field, **paste** the following path **(2)**:
+
[source,text]
----
/home/rhel/myansibleproject/collections/ansible_collections/mynamespace/mycollection/
----
+
    Finally, **click** the blue **OK** button **(3)** to open the folder.
+

.   **View the scaffolded files.**
+
    The VS Code screen will reload. After a few moments, you will see the complete directory structure and all the files created by the Ansible extension for your new collection in the left sidebar.
