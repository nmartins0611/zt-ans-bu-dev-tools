Welcome to our hands-on introduction to Ansible development tools (ADT) and the Ansible extension for VS Code.

In this lab we will introduce you to the `ansible-dev-tools` package, and walk you through creating, testing and deploying an Ansible collection using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and the Ansible extension.

For this hands-on laboratory the Ansible development tools package and all its dependencies are already installed and everything is pre-setup.
During the following challenges you will learn how to start using the tools by doing practical exercises.

= ☑️ Task 1 - Using the Ansible Extension

Let's get started with the new graphical interface for Ansible creator, a new tool and feature of the Ansible extension for VS Code.

. In the left sidebar of VS Code, you will see an Ansible icon.
image:/image.png[image.png]
. That's the Ansible extension, which has been pre-installed for you.
Click on it to see the available options.
. You will see 3 sections in the left sidebar:
 .. Ansible Development Tools
 .. Ansible Lightspeed
 .. Ansible Lightspeed Feedback
. We will be working with the first one.
Let's collapse the two Lightspeed sections for now:  image:/Apr-29-2025_at_13.49.45-image.png[Apr-29-2025_at_13.49.45-image.png]

= ☑️ Task 2 - Create a collection project

. Click on the *Collection project* link.
image:/Apr-29-2025_at_13.51.07-image.png[Apr-29-2025_at_13.51.07-image.png]
. A new tab within VS Code will open, with the form to create a new Ansible collection:   image:/image.png[image.png]
. Fill in the fields with the following information:
 .. Namespace: `mynamespace`
 .. Collection: `mycollection`
 .. Init path:
+
----
 /home/rhel/myansibleproject/collections/ansible_collections/mynamespace/mycollection
----

 .. And tick the last checkbox ✅ `Install collection from source code (editable mode)`
. Now click the blue "*Create*" button   image:/image.png[image.png]
. After a few moments, you should see creation details in the *Logs* box   image:/image.png[image.png]

= ☑️ Task 3 - Create a playbook project

. In the Ansible icon sidebar
. Click on the *Playbook project* link   image:/May-12-2025_at_18.31.56-image.png[May-12-2025_at_18.31.56-image.png]
. A new tab within VS Code will open with the form to create a new Ansible playbook project
. Fill in the fields with the following:
 .. Destination directory: `/home/rhel/myansibleproject`
 .. Namespace: `mynamespace`
 .. Collection: `mysecondcollection`
 .. Click the "Create" button, after a couple of seconds you should see a message similar to this:
+
----
--- ansible-creator logs ---
Note: playbook project created at /home/rhel/myansibleproject
----

= ☑️ Task 3 - Open the Ansible collection folder in VS Code

. Now due to a laboratory infrastructure limitation, we are going to manually open the folder where we created our Ansible content.
. On VS Code left sidebar click the file *Explorer* icon   image:/Apr-29-2025_at_13.57.13-image.png[Apr-29-2025_at_13.57.13-image.png]
. And then click the (1) Open Folder button,
. Paste the following path (2):
+
----
 /home/rhel/myansibleproject/collections/ansible_collections/mynamespace/mycollection/
----

. And click the blue OK (3) button to the right.

. The VS Code screen will reload and after a few moments you will see the list of directories and files created by the Ansible extension for your collection in the left sidebar   image:../asset
