_A guide to testing your Ansible collection using Ansible Molecule and a pre-configured test scenario._

== Lab Briefing

In this challenge, you will explore and test the collection you created using **Ansible Molecule**.

Ansible Molecule is a tool designed to aid in developing and testing Ansible playbooks, collections, and roles. It provides support for testing Ansible content across multiple instances, operating systems, and providers.

**Scenarios** are the starting point for Molecule's powerful functionality. Think of a scenario as a test suite for your Ansible content. You can have as many scenarios as you like, and Molecule will run them sequentially.

== Lab Guide: Hands-On Tasks

Now, let's explore the test scenario that was automatically added to your collection project.

=== Task 1: Explore the Molecule Scenario

When you created the collection in the previous challenge, `ansible-creator` also generated a Molecule test scenario named `integration_hello_test`.

.   **Locate the Molecule scenario.** In the VS Code file explorer, **expand** the following directory path: `collections/ansible_collections/mynamespace/mycollection/extensions/molecule/integration_hello_world`.

.   **Examine the Molecule configuration.** Within the `integration_hello_world` directory, **open** the `molecule.yml` file. Molecule uses this file to define the settings and scenarios for testing the Ansible collection.

.   **Examine the test playbook.** Under the `extensions` directory, **expand** the `utils/playbooks` directory. **Open** the `converge.yml` playbook and observe how it is structured to call integration tests from the `tests/` directory.

=== Task 2: Create a Filter Plugin

Next, you will add a new filter plugin to your collection using the Ansible extension.

.   **Open the Collection plugin creator.** In the VS Code sidebar, **click** the Ansible extension icon. In the *ADD* section, **click** **Collection plugin**.

.   **Fill out the plugin details.** **Fill** out the form with the following information:
* **Collection root directory:**
+
[source,text]
----
/home/rhel/myansibleproject/collections/ansible_collections/mynamespace/mycollection/
----
* **Plugin type:** `Filter`
* **Plugin name:** `hello_world`

.   **Create the plugin** by clicking the blue **Create** button.

=== Task 3: Run the Molecule Test

Finally, you will use the command line to run the Molecule test scenario.

.   **Navigate to the correct directory.** In the VS Code Terminal, **change** to the `extensions/` sub-directory of your collection:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd /home/rhel/myansibleproject/collections/ansible_collections/mynamespace/mycollection/extensions/
----

.   **Run a bare Molecule test.** First, run `molecule test` without specifying a scenario. You will see error messages, which is expected because you must provide a scenario name.
+
[source,bash]
----
molecule test
----

.   **Run the test with the correct scenario.** Now, **run** the command again, this time specifying the scenario with the `-s` flag:
+
[source,bash]
----
molecule test -s integration_hello_world
----

.   **Observe the successful test run.** Success! You can see Molecule running the included tests and confirming that all assertions passed.
